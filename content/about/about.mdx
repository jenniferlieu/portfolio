## Who am I? 🤔
Hey there! I'm Jennifer, a full-stack developer, computer science graduate at your service! 🫡 I build things with code, curiosity, and ✨ controlled chaos ✨ *\*Shakes hand\** Nice to meet you! 

When I get home, I either get lost in the code, watch anime, take a walk, or fend off my tbr list.

Currently, I'm building a budgeting app for myself. The goal is to submit an iOS and Mac app to the App Store with a web app protoype.

## How did I get here? 🤯
I accidentally became an amateur developer when I wanted to customize the "about me" section of my MySpace page. Before I knew it, I had created multiple designs in Photoshop, changed my theme almost every other week, and had memorized a fair amount of CSS attributes. My obsession with web development along with my new found skills led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at my state university, Temple University.

As I was learning how to be a \~real programmer\~, the web dev world exploded around me. Bam. Frameworks! <span className="whitespace-nowrap">( ﾉ･o･ )ﾉ</span> SSG! <span className="whitespace-nowrap">( ﾉ･o･ )ﾉ</span> *\*Noises to the moon.\** 🚀 I was overwhelmed by the rocketship level of progress from the time when CSS could barely handle 2 columns. But more than anything, I was excited and jumping with joy because my childhood dream of hosting a free website was literally a few button presses away.

Even after graduating, some my favorite projects are still ones the I've built for the web. You can [check them out](/#projects) on the homepage!

## Well... you're here, so how can I help you? 😁
If you’re looking for someone who can bring ideas to life, you’ve come to the right place. I work across the stack building responsive UIs and robust backends. I love building things that make people’s lives a little easier (and a little prettier ✨).

Let’s build something cool together! <span className="whitespace-nowrap">°˖✧◝(⁰▿⁰)◜✧˖°</span>
